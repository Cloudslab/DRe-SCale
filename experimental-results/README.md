### Experimental Results

This folder contains the plots for the comparative study for 
- [LSTM-PPO](../scaling-agents/LSTM-PPO/)
- [PPO](../scaling-agents/PPO/) 
- [DRQN](../scaling-agents/DRQN/)
- Kubernetes/OpenFaaS-Horizontal Pod Autoscaler 
- OpenFaaS-Request Per Second Scaling policy

#### Folder Structure <br>
-   [Comparison Plots](./images/) covered in paper
-   [Analysis File](./analysisUtility.ipynb) for parsing and plotting the training and evaluation traces

__Note:__ <br>
The analysis file provided is a utility file meant for deriving the results when using Stable Baseline 3 RL algorithms or its modification. It also provides the utility for reading the logs generated by `env.py` i.e., custom logs. Users should first verify the logging outputs of the algorithms and then take this `analysisUtility.ipynb` as a reference for reading and plotting the respective logs.
